* Ruby 1.0 was released on 12/25/1996

## Ruby's Influences & MRI

* Perl's principle of "there is more than one way to do it" was incorporated into development of Ruby

* Ruby allows programmers the ability to change many details of the language's operation within their own programs on the fly (called reflection)

* Ruby was also inspired (to a lesser extent) by Python, Lisp, Eiffel, Ada & C++

* Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI) was the reference implementation of Ruby & until the mid-2000s, it was the only reliable way to run Ruby scripts

* alternate implementations to MRI include: IronRuby, Jruby and Rubinius
